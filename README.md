### Introduction

Housekeeper was built as a tool to keep student households organized. Join or create your house and keep track of tasks that need to be completed.

### Notable features

- User authentication to sign up, login and join/create your house
- Create tasks that you want completed and the date it needs to be completed by
- Assign tasks to yourself that you can complete
- Check the dashboard for a kanban board view of all the tasks in the house

### How it was built

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) to build simple yet powerful UI components
- [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) to bootstrap and build the app
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) to style our React components
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to store tasks, users, and houses
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) to query and mutate data from the database to the frontend
